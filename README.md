## Key Features ✨

- **Personalized Workout Plans**: Get customized workout routines that suit your fitness level and goals. 📝
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your progress and achievements to stay motivated. 📊
- **Secure Authentication**: Keep your data safe with Firebase Authentication. 🔒
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Enjoy seamless data synchronization with Firebase Firestore. 🔄
- **Media Storage**: Store and retrieve workout media using Firebase Storage. 🗄️

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Kotlin**: For developing the Android application.
- **Firebase Platform**:
  - **Firestore**: For real-time database and storage.
  - **Firebase Auth**: For authentication and user management.
  - **Firebase Storage**: For storing user profile images and other media.
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous programming and managing background tasks.
- **Clean Architecture**: For a robust and scalable architecture.
- **MVI (Model-View-Intent)**: For a unidirectional data flow and state management.
- **Jetpack Compose for TV**: For building the UI with a focus on reusability.
- **Mapper Pattern**: For converting between different data models (DTOs, BOs, etc.).

## Architecture 🏗️

### Clean Architecture

We chose Clean Architecture for the following reasons:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean Architecture helps keep the codebase modular and separates concerns across different layers, making the codebase easier to manage and scale.
- **Independence**: Each layer of the architecture operates independently of frameworks, UI, database, and any external agency.
- **Testability**: With well-defined boundaries and separations, unit testing becomes more straightforward and effective.

### MVI (Model-View-Intent)

MVI complements Clean Architecture by:

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensuring a predictable state management by following a unidirectional data flow.
- **State Management**: Managing the state effectively, making the UI reflect the current state of the application.
- **Reactivity**: Ensuring the UI reacts to state changes, making the application more responsive and robust.

### Repository Pattern

The repository pattern abstracts the data layer, providing a clean API for data access. This helps in managing data from multiple sources (local database, remote server) and makes the data layer more modular and testable.

### Mapper Pattern

Mappers are used to convert data between different layers of the application (e.g., from network DTOs to business objects). This ensures that each layer of the application works with its own data format, keeping the layers decoupled and easier to manage.

### Jetpack Compose for TV

We use Jetpack Compose for TV to:

- **Reusability**: Build UI components that are highly reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Declarative UI**: Create UIs in a declarative manner, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt the UI for different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless experience on TV screens.

## Firebase Platform Integration 🔥

### Firestore

- **Real-time Database**: Firestore is used to store and sync data in real-time across all clients.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to handle large datasets and high-traffic applications.

### Firebase Auth

- **User Authentication**: Firebase Auth is used to handle user authentication, supporting email/password sign-in, third-party providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), and anonymous sign-in.

### Firebase Storage

- **Media Storage**: Firebase Storage is used to store user profile images and other media files, ensuring fast and secure uploads and downloads.
